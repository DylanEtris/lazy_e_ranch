It sleeps 4 with Army style cots and pads, two upstairs and two cots available for downstairs if needed.   It is a Rustic old cabin.  The beauty is you can truly unwind and unplug from society, it is completely unplugged there are no lights or electricity, there are numerous hanging candle lanterns and a beautiful wood burning cook stove used for both cooking and heat, it has one room with a loft, so space is limited, there is a working gravity shower, (cold water only) and a working outhouse, you are truly living like the settlers did.   The Kitchen area is stocked with cast iron cookware and washable/Reusable heavy-duty plastic ware and cups.  There is an array of seasonings available, the wood burning cook stove has a side area for heating water and an oven.  Coffee grounds will be provided, so you will need to heat your own water.  There is a charcoal grill outside along with a picnic table and campfire area, Children are very welcome however there are ladder type stairs that access the upper sleeping area, (however they can be removed if the need arise)  but maybe not preferred for younger children, however 2 additional cots can be assembled and placed downstairs to accommodate younger guests, you are welcome to bring tents and setup near the cabin for additional guests, however each additional guest will be charged $25.00 dollars per night A generator and electric cord can be rented for an additional daily fee.   The property is located on 231 acres with many hiking trails, and ponds, you are welcome to bring your ATV, but a liability Waiver must be signed before you swim or ride.  Smoking is allowed on the property but NOT inside the Cabin, an ash tray will be provided, so don’t throw your butts on the grounds. </p> 
<p>Lake Liberty is located within 6 miles of the Cabin, and Lake Cumberland is only a half hour away, we are located in the middle of Amish country, so don’t be surprised to see Horse and Buggies on the roads. </p>
